# Hello!

Over time, I looked up, learned and created some things for various reasons or projects. There are also things Im tired of answering again.

Along the way I *decided to note* some things, and here you can find those.
If you want more carefully written articles, have a look at my [BLOG](https://blog.decided.to).

IF YOU DONT SEE THE MENU, ROTATE YOUR DEVICE. You can then rotate it back, it's a bug on mobile devices....

### internal links

In case you are wondering WTF those numbers are: they are internal links used by [zettlr](https://zettlr.com).

### Languages

My default will be english, but in case I accidentally wrote in German (\*-de), im not going to spend time translating. Use [deepl](https://deepl.com).

For my fellow germans: blabliblub-de zeigt dass die Datei auf Deutsch ist. Auch hier der Hinweis, dass [deepl](https://deepl.com) existiert.
