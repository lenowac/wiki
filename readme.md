# Hello!

Over time, I looked up, learned and created some things for various reasons or projects. There are also things Im tired of answering again.

Along the way I ***decided to note*** some things, and here you can find those.

<br></br>
 
## Content
 
[[0-selfhosting]] covers linux servers, [[0-computers]] is more desktop / end user focussed.
If you want more carefully written articles, have a look at my [BLOG](https://blog.decided.to). 
 
[[literatur]] sollte mmn natürlich _IMMER_ sehr umständlich über die UNI VPN kommen. Wenn du welche hast, möchtest du vlt auch deine [[literatur-organisieren]].
 
<br></br>

## Languages
 
My default is english, it's easier with IT related stuff. Some notes, depending on the target group, are in german. 
If you desperatly want to read something, [deepl](https://deepl.com) exists.
