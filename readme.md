# Hello!

Over time, I looked up, learned and created some things for various reasons or projects. There are also things Im tired of answering again.

Along the way I ***decided to note*** some things, on this site you can find some of my thoughts.

IF YOU DONT SEE THE MENU, ROTATE YOUR DEVICE. You can then rotate it back, it's a bug on mobile devices....

<br/>

## Languages

My default is english, it's easier with IT related stuff. Some notes, depending on the target group, are in german. 
If you desperatly want to read something, [deepl](https://deepl.com) exists.

<br/>

## Content

[[_selfhosting]] covers linux servers, [[_computers]] is more desktop / end user focussed.
If you want more carefully written articles, have a look at my [BLOG](https://blog.decided.to).

[de] [[literatur]] sollte mmn natürlich _IMMER_ sehr umständlich über die UNI VPN kommen. Wenn du welche hast, möchtest du vlt auch deine [[literatur-organisieren]].
