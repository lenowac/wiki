# Hello!

Over time, I looked up, learned and created some things for various reasons or projects. Along the way I ***decided to note*** some things, and here you can find those.    

This includes documentation, small guides, a quick overview about topics and also serves as a FAQ space for things I'm tired of answering again.    


I have to pay for (ridiciously expensive) domains and servers while taking the time off to write stuff.    
So yea, im totally gonna bag for your [financial support](https://liberapay.com/lenowac) <3 ^^

## Content
 
[[0-selfhosting]] covers linux servers, [[0-computers]] is more desktop / end user focussed.
If you want more carefully written articles, have a look at my [BLOG](https://blog.decided.to).    
 
### German stuff

[[literatur]] sollte mmn natürlich _IMMER_ sehr umständlich über die UNI VPN kommen. Wenn du welche hast, möchtest du vlt auch deine [[literatur-organisieren]].    

Für sichere Kommunikation ist [[matrix]] eine super Sache.
    

## Languages
 
My default is english, it's easier with IT related stuff. Some notes, depending on the target group, are in german. 
If you desperatly want to read something, [deepl](https://deepl.com) exists.
