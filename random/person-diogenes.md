# Person: Diogenes

There are numerous stories about a mate commonly called "Diogenes the Cynic", and although its disputable that he actually existed, the stories and their value is still great. Moving on...

<br>

Diogenes was quite the madlad, he basically fucked with everyone including the most powerful rulers and got away with it.

He was a philosopher, most of his ideas are imo actually pretty genius and still relevant.

Some absolutely fire excerpts from Wikipedia:

## After death

When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, "Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!" When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied: "If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?" [[1 [37]]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes#cite_note-37)

## Burns

- while Diogenes was relaxing in the morning sunlight, [Alexander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_and_Alexander), thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight."
- Alexander then declared, "If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes." "If I were not Diogenes, I would still wish to be Diogenes," Diogenes replied.
- Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, "I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave." [[1 [34]]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes#cite_note-34)

## Noteable idea's

**Minimalism** _He destroyed the single wooden bowl he possessed on seeing a peasant boy drink from the hollow of his hands._ [[1 [23]]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes#cite_note-23)
